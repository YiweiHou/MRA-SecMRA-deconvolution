# MRA-SecMRA-deconvolution
Supplementary software for the manuscript "Multi-resolution analysis enables fidelity-ensured deconvolution for fluorescence microscopy".

Currently, the package contains the .m source code and a .exe files containing GUI of the algorithms with one test dataset.
For more test data, please access: https://figshare.com/articles/Fig./Fluorescence_image_zip/24100263
# System requirements
MRA&DeepMRA deconvolution package only requires a standard computer.

The software is implemented with MATALB 2020b and tested in Windows 10&11 environments.
# Installation guide
The package does not need additional installation steps. 

To run the .exe files, the MATLAB software is not necessary but one should download and install the 15 MATLAB runtime version 2020b for compiling from: https://ww2.mathworks.cn/products/compiler/matlab-runtime.html. After the installation, the MRA & DeepMRA deconvolution software can be readily used.

To run the .m GUI, users need to install MATLAB at any version (this code is written based on MATLAB 2020b, different MATLAB version may have different function rules that influence the functioning). Open the MRA.m or DeepMRA.m file, then click run to activate the software.
